<h2>Review your diff</h2>

No matter how much I try to clean up, I always find mistakes when
reviewing my own diff.

<h2>Explicit Is Better Than Implicit</h2>

This is one of the most important principles.  It means avoiding all
forms of action at a distance.  It means tracing all dependencies to a
specific line of code instantiating them.  It means avoiding defaults.
<p>
It does not mean fearing defaults of the language.  For example,
non-<code>final</code> members default to <code>null</code>; this is
explicitly documented behavior.
<p>
  Note:  temporary defaults are required during transitions, e.g.
  <ol>
    <li>Add optional input
    <li>Update all dependents to supply the new input
    <li>Remove default, making the input required
  </ol>

<h2>Naming</h2>
<li>Is the name clear and specific?
<li>Usually should not simply repeat the type name
<li>Are similar things named similarly?
<li>
  Names of instantiable classes should be singular, even a collection:
  an instance is always just one thing; even a list of lists is itself
  only one list
<li>
  Classes should be named as agent nouns (usually ending in '-er' or
  '-or') with that noun last in compound names
  (e.g. <code>FrobValidator</code>)
<li>
  methods should be named as verbs, leading with the verb in compound
  names(e.g. <code>#validateName</code>)
<li>
  <a name="naming-stuttering">
    Minimize <a href="#stuttering">stuttering</a> in names:
  </a>
  prefer <code>package.frob.Validator#validate</code>
  to <code>package.frob.FrobValidator#validateFrob</code>
<li>
  Don't duplicate information from the types; prefer <code>lookup(Id)</code> and
  <code>lookup(Email)</code> to <code>lookupId(Id)</code>
  and <code>lookupEmail(email)</code>
<li>
  Avoid phrases such as 'helper' and 'util': they indicate a dumping
  ground of unrelated concerns
  (see <a href="#separation-of-concern">"Separation of Concern"</a>)
  which is bad enough, but then dumping grounds attract more dumping.
<li>
  Group static methods into non-instantiable classes named for the
  types on which they operate, in the plural,
  e.g. <code>Users</code>, <code>Files</code>
  <p>
  Make a class non-instantiable by declaring itse default constructor
  as <code>private</code> and with a body throwing
  <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code></li>

<h2>
  <a name="separation-of-concern">
    Separation of concern
  </a>
</h2>

Each class should do one job and do it well.
<p>
Methods, doubly so.

<h2>Information hiding</h2>

Yes, have some.

<h2>Smells</h2>
<li>Constructor does work
<li>Digging into collaborators (Law of Demeter)
<li>Primitive obsession</li>

<h2>Mutability</h2>

Mutable classes are bug-prone.
<p>
Rarely should a class be mutable (changed after construction).  Most
common exceptions are accumulator classes such as builders.  If a
class is mutable, it should almost certainly be single-use.

<h2>Assignability</h2>

Assignable variables are bug-prone.
<p>
Declare all identifiers <code>final</code> by default.  If it's
assignable, the value will change behind your back.
<p>
Limit the scope of non-<code>final</code> identifiers.  If they're
members, ensure the class is short-lived (e.g. a builder).  If they're
variables, put them into their own method, whose callers store the
results in a <code>final</code>.

<h2>Single-use class</h2>

If a class is single-use, enforce that by throwing
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/IllegalStateException.html"><code>IllegalStateException</code></a>
upon reuse.

<h2>Inheritance</h2>
<li>Favor composition over inheritance.  Very old advice, still the best.
<li>Inheritance is the tightest form of coupling.
<li>
  Either design for inheritance or forbid it.  Mark all methods either
  abstract or <code>final</code>, preferably by marking the enclosing
  class.
<li>The bad fruits of inheritance are multiplied by each level.</li>

<h2>Injection</h2>
<li>Instantiation is the second tighest form of coupling
<li>Dependencies must be injected
<li>
  When a class must instantiate, it should do so via an injected
  factory, e.g. call the make method of the <code>ValidationResultFactory</code>
  interface rather than <code>new ValidationResult()</code>
</li>

<h2><code>null</code></h2>

<code>null</code> is not just bug-prone, is is
the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=billion+dollar+mistake">billion-dollar
mistake</a>.
<p>
<li><code>requireNonNull</code> on all parameters to all public methods
<li>
  If a parameter is optional, use an overload (or maybe, but probably
  not, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Optional.html"><code>Optional</code></a>)
<li>
  Don't return <code>null</code>; return a default,
  return <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Optional.html"><code>Optional</code></a>,
  or throw an exception
<li>
  Check all dependency method return values for <code>null</code>; if
  it can't return <code>null</code> today, it will tomorrow
</li>

<h2><code>Optional</code></h2>

Don't use <code>Optional#get</code>, which defeats the purpose.

<h2>Scope</h2>

The wider the scope, the more prone to bugs.
<p>
Declare identifiers in the narrowest possible scope and as late in
that scope as possible.

<h2>Member initialization</h2>

Prefer member initialization in these locations, in order of
decreasing preference:
<ol>
<li>declaration
<li>initialization block
<li>constructor
</ol>

<h2>Lambda</h2>

<li>should be treated as joints or pipe fittings
<li>should not contain business logic
<li>
  capture data from enclosing scope and pass off to proper methods
</li>

<h2>
  <a name="stuttering">
    Minimize stuttering
  </a>
</h2>
See <a href="#naming-stuttering">stuttering</a> section in "Naming" above.
<p>
Prefer <code>var frobs = new ArrayList&lt;Frob&gt;()</code>

<h2>IntelliJ formatting</h2>
<li>
  Don't waste your time on formatting: have IntelliJ format all
  changed files (if working in a legacy code-base, select a region of
  code to format)
<li>
  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google-java-format">google-java-format</a>
  is even better if the project allows it, as pre-check-in hooks can
  be installed to prevent check-ins of malformatted code.
</li>

<h2>Comments</h2>
<li>Well-named classes and methods are self-documenting to a large extent
<li>Comments should tell why and how rather than what
<li>
  Javadoc is great, but should not duplicate information specified by
  names or types.
</li>

<h2>Exception handling</h2>
<li>
  <code>try</code> blocks catching multiple exceptions should contain
  only one method call which throws all the caught exceptions
<li>
  <code>try</code> blocks catching only one exception should contain
  only method calls which throw the one exception
  (<code>IOException</code> is a common example), but only if all
  exceptions are to be handled the same way
<li>
  Declare in <code>throws</code> clause or wrap
  and <code>throw</code>?  If the exception is of a type at the same
  layer as the method encountering the exception, <code>throws</code>
  is probably right; otherwise, wrap
  and <code>throw</code>.  <code>throws</code> is a tight coupling!
<li>
  Avoid
  catching <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/RuntimeException.html"><code>RuntimeException</code></a>
  where possible.  For example
  catching <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/IllegalStateException.html"><code>IllegalStateException</code></a>
  is papering over a bug: instead, don't enter the illegal state in
  the first place.  Many dependencies force your hand by
  throwing <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/RuntimeException.html"><code>RuntimeException</code></a>
  for routine errors which must be handled</li>

<h2>Logging</h2>
<li>Does this tell an operator anything an incremented counter does not?
<li>Is this actionable?
<li>
  When an operator encounters this log entry, does it tell them
  everything they need to know?  E.g. user identifiers, correlated
  timestamps
<li>Is the log entry expensive to compute and logged at high frequency?</li>

<h2>Style</h2>
<li>Don't break line between new or builder and the type name (<code>Foo.builder()</code> and <code>new Foo()</code>)
